GFlix is an application that am building to demonstrate modular project design via grails plugins.  I will be presenting this project at the Kansas City Java Users Group May 11, 2011.  Afterwhich I might possibly do a screencast.  GFlix is inspired by Netflix but from an administration and webservice perspective.  I also may include some social aspects along the way.
